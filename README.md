# Morphing graph

![Demo](demo/demo.gif)

Playing with new libraries - d3.js and Svelte. As example I created morphing graph with indicator that shows a stock value of technology companies in Q1 2020.

Install the dependencies...

```bash
npm install
```

...then:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
